    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I belong to a large LDS family of four boys and two girls.I grew up participating in many out door activities, but my favorite was biking.</p>

     <p1> I am currently a full time student at BYU studying Computer Science and Statistics. I hope to be able to one day merge my passion for technology and business together and create a startup. </p1>
